# AirBnB Clone

This is a Python command-line interface for an AirBnB clone project, as part of the curriculum at Holberton School. The project aims to create a simple copy of the AirBnB website, allowing users to manage data about places, cities, users, and more.

## Description

The AirBnB clone project is divided into several parts:

1. **Console**: A command-line interface for managing the AirBnB objects. Users can create, update, and delete objects, as well as perform other operations.
2. **Web Static**: A static website built with HTML and CSS, showcasing the front-end design of the AirBnB clone.
3. **MySQL Storage**: Implementation of a MySQL database for storing and retrieving data.
4. **API**: RESTful API for interacting with the AirBnB objects.
5. **Front-End Integration**: Integrating the static website with the API and database for a complete web application.

This repository focuses on the **Console** part of the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Run the console:
## Usage

The console provides several commands for managing AirBnB objects. Here are some examples:

- `create <class_name>`: Create a new instance of a class.
- `show <class_name> <object_id>`: Print the string representation of an instance.
- `all <class_name>`: Print all instances of a class.
- `update <class_name> <object_id> <attribute_name> <attribute_value>`: Update an instance attribute.
- `destroy <class_name> <object_id>`: Delete an instance.
- `quit` or `EOF`: Exit the console.

For more information on available commands and usage, type `help` in the console.
